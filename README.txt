Product Name : Me-Lody

An app developed by Joseph Manall, Ethan Grim, Alex Spetseris, and Jason Nguyen. All of us are students at Drexel University, and this app was developed as a project for CI102 and CI103. Our product is similar to the app BeReal. Instead of posting a picture once a day, our app is related to music. Once you download the app, the user would connect to their preferred music streaming platform. At a random time each day, a notification will be sent out informing the user that it's time to share your music with your friends. If you are currently listening to a song, the app will prompt the user if it is okay to post their song for those they have mutually added to see. If the user is not listening to music, the app will instead ask if it is okay to post their last listened to song.


Our app requires a QR code to be tested and used. This is done by downloading the app through the GitHub, and running "npx expo start". The user must also have the expo go app downloaded on their phone for it to work. Our app then opens through that, and the user can create an account and navigate to their choosing. 

Our app is developed within react native and expo go. We import a lot of applications and commands through base react native commands. Each page on the app corresponds to a page within our code. An example is the page where you post a song is called "PostScreen.tsx" Within each page is necessary functions and applications that our app uses to perform the actions prompted by the user. 

This is dependent on React Native and Expo Go. Without the QR code and the app on your device, our app will not work.
